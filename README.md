# LetsWatchMovews - a react site

I started this project from scratch using viteJs with react, tailwind, redux and reactquery to provide user with a friendly UI that is functional, smooth and responsive in all screen sizes. I used tmdb api to fetch movies and series data using tanstack query that handles the fetching process very efficiently. let's dive more deeper into it:

## Features

- Minimal/Smooth/Functional UI.
- Shows trending, popular, toprated etc movies/series.
- Genre filters can be applied, example: adventure, comedy, animation etc.
- Responsive in all screen sizes including as small as Galaxy z fold to any big screens.
- Shows rating, details and air date of all the cinema available.
- Standard search features.
- Watchlist feature that saves the data on client side/local storage on user's browser.
- Trailer and other related videos of cinema are shown as a playlist.
- External player that plays available cinema directly on website.
- Easy browsing of tv and web series seasons and episodes.
- Infinite scrolling.
- Skeletons fallback while data are being loaded.
- Data fetching handled by tanstack query that uses cache data for faster load and auto handles errors that may occur.
- Cast crew of the cinema.
- Similar Movies/Shows recommendation feature.
